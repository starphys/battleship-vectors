Battleship vectors reimagines Battleship as a battle between two vessels in space. 
Each ship attempts to hit the other, and each miss indicates how far from the enemy ship the shot was. 
To avoid detection, ships can forgo a shot to modify their velocity, making it harder for the other ship to determine their trajectory. 

Currently this is a single player experience against a pseudo-random AI. After each game, refresh for a new, randomly generated starting configuration!
